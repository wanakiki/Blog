# About the bottom-up development

**Bottom-up development** is a style of developing programs. With  the  bottom-up  development, we  develop  in  the  reverse  inside-out  fashion; that is, we develop the service classes first. To test the service classes, we write a temporary dummy main class. After the service classes are done, we complete the top-level class that  uses  these  service  classes.  The  bottom-up  development  for  this  program  implements the `Loanclass` first fully and then the `LoanCalculatorclass`.

<!-- more -->

# Development steps

In this example, we write the **service class** (`Loanclass`) and write the **main** function in the `Loanclass`  to test the `Loanclass`. Next, we create a `LoanCalculatorclass` to **handle the user's input and output**, and compute the monthly and total payments by calling the member method (`getLoan()`) of `Loanclass`.

# Loan class

## Step 1

First, we write a **constructor** (`Loan()`) to receive three **form parameters** (`double amount`, `double rate` and `int period`), and assign them to **member variables** (`double amount`, `double rate` and `int period`).

Second, we write two **dummy function** (`double getMonPay()` and `double getTotalPay()`) .

Third, we write a `main` function to test the `Loanclass`.

**Source code:**

```java
class Loan {
    private final int MONTHS_IN_YEAR = 12;
    private double amount; // Loan amount
    private double rate; // Lnterest rate
    private int period; // Loan period

    // Constructor
    public Loan(double amount, double rate, int period){
        this.amount = amount;
        this.rate = rate;
        this.period = period;
    }

    // Calculating monthly payments
    public double getMonPay(){
        return 100.1;
    }

    // Calculating the total payments
    public double getTotalPay(){
        return 112312.1212;
    }


    // TEST
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double amount = 100.3;
        double rate = 22;
        int period = 12;

        Loan loan = new Loan(amount, rate, period);

        System.out.println("Expected value: " + amount + " Actual value： " + loan.amount);
        System.out.println("Expected value: " + rate + " Actual value： " + loan.rate);
        System.out.println("Expected value: " + period + " Actual value： " + loan.period);

        System.out.println("Expected value: " + 100.1 + " Actual value： " + loan.getMonPay());

        System.out.println("Expected value: " + 112312.1212 + " Actual value： " + loan.getTotalPay());
    }   
}
```

**operation result:**

```bash
Expected value: 100.3 Actual value： 100.3
Expected value: 22.0 Actual value： 22.0
Expected value: 12 Actual value： 12
Expected value: 100.1 Actual value： 100.1
Expected value: 112312.1212 Actual value： 112312.1212
```

## Step 2

Complete the logic in the **dummy function** to make it a true **member method**.

Use the **real value** in the **main function** to test whether the logic of the **member method** (`double getMonPay()` and `double getTotalPay()`) is correct.

**Source code:**

```java
// Calculating monthly payments
public double getMonPay(){
    return (amount * (rate / 100.0)) / MONTHS_IN_YEAR;
}

// Calculating the total payments
public double getTotalPay(){
    return amount + ((amount * (rate / 100.0)) * period);
}
```

**operation result:**

```bash
Expected value: 100.3 Actual value： 100.3
Expected value: 22.0 Actual value： 22.0
Expected value: 12 Actual value： 12
Expected value: 1.838833 Actual value： 1.8388333333333333
Expected value: 365.092 Actual value： 365.092
```

So far, the `Loanclass` has been completed.

# Loan Calculator class

## Step 1

First, we write a **member method** (`void getInput()`) to handle **input** and another **member method** (`void getOutput()`) to handle **output**.

Sexond, we write a **fake main function** to test the input and output.

**Source code:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class LoanCalculator {
    private double amount; // Loan amount
    private double rate; // Lnterest rate
    private int period; // Loan period
    private double monPayment; // Monthly payment
    private double totalPayment; // Total payment

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LoanCalculator loanCalculator = new LoanCalculator();

        loanCalculator.getInput();
        System.out.println("Input: " + loanCalculator.amount + " " + loanCalculator.rate + " " + loanCalculator.period);

        System.out.println();

        loanCalculator.monPayment = 100.1;
        loanCalculator.totalPayment = 200.2;
        loanCalculator.getOutput();
    }

    // Processing input
    private void getInput(){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Your loan amount: $");
        amount = sc.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Your loan interest rate (%): ");
        rate = sc.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Your loan period (year): ");
        period = sc.nextInt();

        sc.close();
    }

    // Processing output
    private void getOutput(){
        System.out.println("Your monthly payment is $" + monPayment);
        System.out.println("Your total payment is $" + totalPayment);
    }
}
```

**operation result:**

```bash
Your loan amount: $100.1
Your loan interest rate (%): 33.2
Your loan period (year): 12
Input: 100.1 33.2 12

Your monthly payment is $100.1
Your total payment is $200.2
```

## Step 2

Rewrite the **main function**, call the `getMonPay()` method of the `Loan` class to calculating the monthly payments, and call the `getTotalPay()` method of the `Loan` class to calculating the total payments.

**Source code:**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    LoanCalculator loanCalculator = new LoanCalculator();

    loanCalculator.getInput();

    Loan loan = new Loan(loanCalculator.amount, loanCalculator.rate, loanCalculator.period);
    System.out.println();

    loanCalculator.monPayment = loan.getMonPay();
    loanCalculator.totalPayment = loan.getTotalPay();
    loanCalculator.getOutput();
}
```

**operation result:**

```bash
Your loan amount: $100
Your loan interest rate (%): 22
Your loan period (year): 10

Your monthly payment is $1.8333333333333333
Your total payment is $320.0
```

Completed!!! ヾ(*´▽'*)ﾉ.
